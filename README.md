# ToDo App on React

This is my first relatively big project on React. It's a simple todo app, in which I used various packages.

While developing the project, I embraced all the pain of configuring the project. This is the case, when configuration took much more time, than the actual code writing, so I hope you'll appreciate the work done.

The project is deployed on vercel. You can check it [here](https://react-todo-app-henna-one.vercel.app/).

The list of used tools:

- Tailwind
- Classnames
- Prop-types
